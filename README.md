# CustomGameEngine


 
This project was a semester long project during my second to last semester in graduate school at FIEA. 

​

I was tasked to create a game engine from scratch in C++. This game engine had to be data driven and the engine had to be able to parse a custom format of JSON to allow users to create games with ease.

​

To do so, I created runtime polymorphic data structures, with the help of RTTI (Runtime Type Information, with an in depth readable API that focused on ease of use, with easy to manage ownership/responsibility.

​

To make sure everything ran the way I designed it to, I constructed a multitude of unit tests and made sure they all passed and that I wasn't leaking any memory.
